This is my submission for the CoffeeDrop challenge.

I came across some issues with the API endpoint as it would not allow me to retrieve the data without running into a CORS issue. 
Initially, I assumed that I had not attached the appropriate headers to my request, but after multiple tries I was not successful. 
The only way I was able to use it was by disabling CORS on Chrome. Could it be a server issue instead?

Thank you for your time.
